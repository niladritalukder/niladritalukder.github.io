Niladri’s dissertation, “Material Degradation and Analysis of N-Doped Graphene/MOF Nanocatalysts for ORR in Electrochemical Energy Systems,” presents an integrated theoretical and experimental investigation of nitrogen-doped graphene (N-G) and N-G/MOF nanocatalysts as sustainable alternatives to precious metal catalysts. The research systematically examined synthesis–structure–property relationships, resolving the roles of nitrogen functional groups, electronic structure modulation, and precursor-to-composite chemical transformations in governing oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance. Through detailed electrochemical analysis, the work established direct correlations between linear sweep voltammetry behavior and ORR mechanisms in both alkaline and acidic environments. Comprehensive degradation studies identified performance losses induced by oxidative species such as hydrogen peroxide and its derivatives, while parallel investigations clarified the structural stability of ZIF-8 in aqueous electrochemical conditions. Collectively, this research provided mechanistic insights and rational design principles for enhancing catalytic activity, durability, and structural resilience in carbon-based electrochemical nanocatalysts.

Building on this foundation, Niladri aims to advance next-generation electrochemical materials for sustainable energy conversion and storage systems. His future work will focus on scalable catalyst design, durability engineering, and structure-driven performance optimization for fuel cells, batteries, and related technologies. By bridging fundamental materials science with applied engineering and commercialization perspectives, he seeks to accelerate the development of high-performance, cost-effective alternatives to precious metal catalysts. His long-term goal is to contribute to resilient, efficient, and globally deployable clean energy technologies.

## Why publish notebooks?

> [!TIP]
> **Reproducible Research**: By publishing the actual notebook, you allow others to download and run your code, verifying your results and building upon your work.

- **No more screenshots** – Render crisp code and vector plots directly from your source.
- **Theme consistent** – Notebooks automatically adapt to your site's theme (including dark mode).
- **Flexible sourcing** – Display notebooks from your `assets/` folder, page bundles, or even directly from a remote GitHub URL.
- **Interactive** – Users can copy code blocks or download the full notebook to run locally.

## Example: Data Science Workflow

Below is a live example of a notebook rendered right here in this post. Notice how the markdown, code, and outputs (text, HTML, and JSON) are all preserved and styled.

{{< notebook
    src="hugoblox-onboarding.ipynb"
    title="Launch Readiness Analysis"
    show_metadata=true
    line_numbers=true
    dense=false
    download_label="Download notebook"
    show_outputs=true
>}}

## How to add a notebook

1. **Save your notebook.** Place your `.ipynb` file in `assets/notebooks/` (for global access) or inside a page bundle (like `content/blog/my-post/analysis.ipynb`).
2. **Add the shortcode.** In any Markdown page, simply use:
   `{{</* notebook src="analysis.ipynb" */>}}`
3. **Customize.** You can hide code cells for non-technical audiences (`show_code=false`) or just show the output (`show_outputs=true`).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Hugo Blox respects your privacy. Notebook rendering happens statically at build time—no third-party services required.

## Next steps

- **Try it out:** Drop one of your existing notebooks into this site and see how it looks.
- **Link your papers:** Use the Embed shortcode to link your notebook to your latest arXiv preprint or GitHub repository.
